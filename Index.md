### Additional References

-The notebooks in the mathmatics folder use a project-specific virtual environment that contain a copy of the global interpreter. To activate the command for the vitual enviorment is : <b>.venv\scripts\activate</b>. For some windows systems, you might get a error about the environment not being digitally signed. In order for this to work you will need to run this command: <b>Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process</b> then run the activate command again.
